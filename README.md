## Important: Originality and Attribution Matter! ðŸŽ¨

We value creativity and original work. Please ensure that your contributions are:

- **Your own original creations**: Do not copy or paste someone else's work without permission.
- **Inspired, not duplicated**: It's okay to be inspired by others, but make sure your work is uniquely yours.
- **Properly attributed**:
  - If you use any third-party resources (e.g., images, fonts), make sure you have the right to use them and provide proper attribution.
  - For recreations of non-open-source effects:
    1. Clearly state that it's a recreation in your submission.
    2. Provide a link to the original source or inspiration.
    3. Explain how your implementation differs or what you learned from the process.

Remember, the goal is to learn and showcase your skills. Plagiarism goes against the spirit of open-source and Hacktoberfest. Let's keep our community creative, respectful, and transparent!
